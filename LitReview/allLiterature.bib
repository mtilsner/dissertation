	abstract = {Service-oriented architectures (SOA) is an emerging approach that addresses the requirements of loosely coupled, standards-based, and protocol- independent distributed computing. Typically business operations running in an SOA comprise a number of invocations of these different components, often in an event-driven or asynchronous fashion that reflects the underlying business process needs. To build an SOA a highly distributable communications and integration backbone is required. This functionality is provided by the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) that is an integration platform that utilizes Web services standards to support a wide variety of communications patterns over multiple transport protocols and deliver value-added capabilities for SOA applications. This paper reviews technologies and approaches that unify the principles and concepts of SOA with those of event-based programing. The paper also focuses on the ESB and describes a range of functions that are designed to offer a manageable, standards-based SOA backbone that extends middleware functionality throughout by connecting heterogeneous components and systems and offers integration services. Finally, the paper proposes an approach to extend the conventional SOA to cater for essential ESB requirements that include capabilities such as service orchestration, ``intelligent'' routing, provisioning, integrity and security of message as well as service management. The layers in this extended SOA, in short xSOA, are used to classify research issues and current research activities.},

	abstract = {Web services have been the main leverage to the development of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), essentially a collection of interacting software agents with a loosely coupling organization. Despite several composition solutions already exist, the integration of services in a seamless and user-friendly way is not yet a complete solved problem. Most of the times, this integration is performed in hard-coded monolithic desktop applications. This paper presents a web-based application, supported on web2.0 principles, that was designed to integrate and coordinate services and data sources, simplifying knowledge extraction in diverse scientific areas. The system architecture follows an agile solution based on workflows, which may be dynamically designed by the user in a common browser. The framework allows building specific protocols for information retrieval enabling the user to access distributed resources in a single centralized interface.},

One key concern in a SOA is thus to provide Message Level Security (as opposed to point to point security). We observe that systems are communicating with each other in a SOA over SOAP messages, often without adequate protection against XML rewriting attacks.We have already provided a solution to protect the integrity of SOAP messages in earlier work [1]. This solution was based on the usage of messagestructure information (SOAP Account) for preservation of message integrity. However, this earlier work did not discuss the issue of forging the SOAP Account itself. In this paper, we discuss the integrity feature of a SOAP Account within a more general context of the current web service security state of the art.},

Though federation is essential in order to address the distributed nature of SOA, these FIdM solutions have been found to be inflexible, unscalable, and difficult to use, manage, and upgrade. We contend that a major reason for these difficulties is that FIdM addresses the wrong aspect of the problem. Specifically, FIdM does not address the federation of access policies. What is needed is a system for Federated Access Management (FAccM). This paper demonstrates the benefits of FAccM over FIdM for SOA deployments and shows how FAccM can be implemented using the existing web services standards.},

	abstract = {The past few years Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) has risen from being a concept promoted by few to become one of the most important architecture styles enterprises are trying to adopt. Though many of the bases upon which SOA is founded are not new, its link to achieving business results makes it very appealing. However, as with any new and promising concept, a great deal of hype is associated with SOA, which could spell trouble for both its promoters and those committed to its adoption. Today there are no shortage of claims from both believers and doubters of its benefits. There are many challenges facing its early adopters as well as missing capabilities needed to support all business needs. The next few years are critical to the success of SOA. To silence its doubters and live up to its high expectations, SOA must evolve and extend to incorporate features from other emerging paradigms, techniques, and architectures. This panel will address the challenges facing enterprises in their attempts to adopt SOA and realize its full benefits, and will shed some light on the future of SOA. The panelists will be asked to address the following questions: 1. 1) Is SOA a revolution which requires a paradigm shift (similar to OO for example)? Or is it an evolution? And what are the challenges? 2. 2) What aspects of current SOAs work well? What evidence do we have? Do we have specific quantified cases showing the business benefits for an enterprise as a result of adopting SOA? 3. 3) What didn't work? (For example, high overhead, performance, methodology, etc.) 4. 4) What does the future hold for SOA? And what are the priorities? (For example, should SOA adopt a light-weight approach similar to Web 2.0, or focus on building Composite Services? How would SOA address 'user needs' Should future SOA enhancements focus on incorporating Event Driven Architecture? Or on providing Hardware as a Service (HaaS)? 5. 5) How do we support larger transaction action based services that can be composed of many smaller autonomous services?.},

Service provider revenue growth will inevitably be software-centric, with the move to software-based systems in the Next Generation Network. Web Services and SOA are quickly becoming a critical component of software middleware to address this need. Initially proven in the IT enterprise space, service providers are adopting SOA and Web Services. For example, at the edge of their networks, service providers are adopting Telecom Web Services for third party access. In the core of their networks, they are adopting IMS Application Server-hosted services. In this paper, we discuss the specific requirements and architectural aspects for both scenarios and point to the applicable trends that impact this domain. We illustrate how Web Services and SOA serve as the foundation for reliable services that can be built more efficiently than with traditional approaches without compromising reliability and manageability.},

	abstract = {Telecom operators have started to make significant investments towards evolving their Service Delivery Platforms (SDPs) to a next-generation architecture based on IP technologies and standards such as SIP, SOA and increasingly, Web 2.0. With consumers and businesses increasingly relying on Web 2.0--oriented services for information, communications, collaboration and entertainment - the key to this evolution would be the integration of Web/SOA middleware and Telecom middleware infrastructure, thereby creating a converged Web-Telecom services layer. To this end, operators are gradually embracing the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) and looking at developing an ecosystem of IMS/SIP--based services that can be mashed up with Web--based applications, in innovative ways. Service delivery is vital for the success of the IMS--based approach. To this end, operators will require greater flexibility around real--time management, control and enhancement of user services at runtime - in a manner that is decoupled from the application logic itself. We observe this need and present the Service Control Layer (SCL), a middleware technology that sits between the IMS service and network plane, and provides operators with the requisite fine-grained control and enrichment over the delivery of next-generation converged services.},

The emerging generation comes from abstracting from software and sees all resources as services in a service-oriented architecture (SOA). In a world of services, it is the service that counts for a customer and not the software or hardware components that implement the service. Service-oriented architectures are rapidly becoming the dominant computing paradigm. However, current SOA solutions are still restricted in their application context to in-house solution of companies. A service web will have billions of services. While service orientation is widely acknowledged for its potential to revolutionize the world of computing by abstracting form underlying hardware and software layers, that success depends on resolving fundamental challenges that SOA does not address currently. The mission of Service Web 3.0 is to provide solutions to integration and search that will enable the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) revolution on a worldwide scale. Hereby we must focus on three major areas where we need to extend current approaches towards service orientation:},

A user must manually bridge the gap between the security requirements and the configuration, which could cause extra configuration costs and lead to potential misconfiguration hazards. To ease this situation, we came up with refining security requirements from business to technology, leveraging the concepts of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Model-Driven Architecture (MDA). Security requirements are gradually transformed to more detailed ones or countermeasures by bridging the gap between them by using best practice patterns.},

We need methods to combine advantages of traditional (i.e. web, desktop, or mobile) application development environments and service-based deployments.In this paper, we focus on the design and implementation of session management as a core service to support business processes and go beyond application-specific sessions and web sessions. We develop local session components for different platforms and complement them with a remote ``session service'' that is independent of applications and platforms. We aim to close the gap between the two worlds by combining their performance, availability and interoperability advantages.},

A fairly well thought out security strategy was developed for second generation Web applications by creating a security sand-box around the HTTP request (until the user was authenticated), then using standard server security to protect the processing and finally extending the ideas of distributed computing to secure accessing data. Web application programming is currently moving to a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) that includes extensive use of Web services. There is a mad rush in the UNIX world to perfect the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and in the Microsoft world to finish the Windows Communications Foundation (WCF). And the beauty of the SOA is that a Web application developed using WCF will be able to access data from a Java Web service. This new SOA will support a distributed application development environment that is truly vendor independent. But, while the new architecture promises to make vendor independent distributed programming a reality, it has introduced a large number of new security concerns. This tutorial will describe SOA, give a brief introduction to computer security and then present SOA security in detail.},

In this paper we argue that in the basic SOA model access to metadata is too static and results in inflexible interactions between requesters and providers. We propose specific extensions to the SOA model to allow service providers and requestors to dynamically expose and negotiate their public behavior, resulting in the ability to specialize and optimize the middleware supporting an interaction. We introduce a middleware architecture supporting this extended SOA functionality, and describe a conformant implementation based on standard Web services middleware. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of this approach with a detailed real world scenario.},

	abstract = {Significant efforts are currently being pursued by several countries and IT providers to deploy SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) designs of digital government systems that integrate or implement workflows of multiple software services and data sources. Unfortunately, many existing applications that can be useful in digital government are not implemented as Web Services, a fact that complicates their integration and interoperation within SOAs. To address this problem, this paper presents an approach to easily wrap text-based applications into Web Services. Compared to other application-wrapping approaches, this paper's solution exposes a simpler interface to users, completely hiding the complexities of understanding and developing Web Services. The approach is motivated by, and effective for, the important case of interactive applications, which is harder than batch-oriented applications and has not been considered by other approaches or software development environments. The paper briefly reviews a transnational digital government (TDG) project that requires interoperation and integration of independently developed geographically distributed information processing tools. The characteristics of SOAs are briefly described, along with their suitability for TDG systems and how they can be developed and deployed. The applications underlying the services needed for TDG are introduced and their SOA-relevant characteristics are identified. A framework is described for turning these applications into Web Services that are secure, support interactivity as needed, and do not constrain application functionality. The use of this framework and the evaluation of its benefits are described in the context of the deployment of application services needed by the TDG project.},

A programmable and machine accessible Web is the vision of many,and might represent a step towards the semantic Web. However, security is a crucial requirement for the serious usage and adoption of the Web services technology. This paper enumerates design goals for an access control model for Web services. It then introduces an abstract general model for Web services components, along with formal definitions and notation that can be used as a basis to design an access control processor independent of a particular Web service implementation. It follows the design of a distributed access control processor built upon this general model for Web services, along with implementation guidelines and examples. Main goals for a general authorization framework are identified, and design spaces enumerated.},

	abstract = {The Web is maturing as a rich application development platform, and efforts are being made to provide richer and more dynamic interactions using JavaScript. JavaScript-based Web applications such as Google Maps have gained extra attention because they can be easily included in HTML for reuse. Unfortunately, various technical hurdles have made it difficult for JavaScript reuse to extend beyond its current state. Furthermore, JavaScript reuse is still out of reach for a large portion of the Web user base unversed in the use of programming languages.In this paper, we dive deeper into our previous work on the JavaScript Dataflow Architecture (JDA). JDA is intended for Web client applications written using HTML and JavaScript. We discuss the ways in which the architecture addresses many of the hurdles that modern Web client applications face in the realm of large-scale reuse and remixing. JDA aims to provide an ecosystem comprised of black box components operating within a JavaScript-based asynchronous message-passing environment. The environment allows you to use simple HTML to assemble Web applications from JavaScript black boxes scattered around the World Wide Web. No programming skill is required in their assembly, and no plug-ins or applets are required for their execution. Furthermore, the architecture extends the black box metaphor beyond the boundaries of JavaScript and allows multiple JavaScript components contained within an HTML file to be reused as a whole.A detailed account of an early prototype is discussed, and research is being done to improve it. JDA suggests that large-scale reuse and arbitrary remixing of Web applications can be realized using currently existing technologies.},

Unfortunately, existing technologies used for service-oriented middleware architectures, such as Web services, P2P systems, coordination and cooperation technologies, and spontaneous networking, do not fully support all requirements in the realm of loosely coupled business services yet. Typical problems that arise in many business domains are for instance missing central control, complex cooperation models, complex lookup models, or issues regarding dynamic deployment. We used a pattern-based approach to identify the well working solutions in the different technologies for loosely coupled services. Then we reused this design knowledge in our concept for a service-oriented middleware. This concept is centered around a controlled environment, called a federation. Each remote object (a peer service) is controlled in one or more federations, but within this environment peers can collaborate in a simple-to-use, loosely coupled, and ad hoc style of communication. A semantic lookup service is used to let the peers publish rich metadata about themselves to their fellow peers.},

This paper proposes an approach to design self-adaptive service-oriented architectures. The approach enables clients to automatically adapt their behavior to alternative web services that provide compatible functionality through different interaction protocols. It uses an infrastructure that traces the successful interactions of the web services, automatically synthesize models that approximate the interaction protocols, and steer client-side adaptations at runtime.},

Application development is often done in an ad hoc manner, without standard frameworks or libraries, thus resulting in poor reuse of software assets. Web services have received much interest in industry due to their potential in facilitating seamless business-to-business or enterprise application integration. A web services composition tool can help automate the process, from creating business process functionality, to developing executable workflows, to deploying them on an execution environment. However, we find that the main approaches taken thus far to standardize and compose web services are piecemeal and insufficient. The business world has adopted a (distributed) programming approach in which web service instances are described using WSDL, composed into flows with a language like BPEL and invoked with the SOAP protocol. Academia has propounded the AI approach of formally representing web service capabilities in ontologies, and reasoning about their composition using goal-oriented inferencing techniques from planning. We present the first integrated work in composing web services end to end from specification to deployment by synergistically combining the strengths of the above approaches. We describe a prototype service creation environment along with a use-case scenario, and demonstrate how it can significantly speed up the time-to-market for new services.},

Our method is based on existing models for the specification of business processes (BPMN) combined with Web engineering models for designing and developing semantically rich Web applications (WebML). The proposed approach leads from an abstract view of the business needs to a concrete implementation of the application by means of several design steps; high-level models are transformed into software components. Our framework increases the efficiency of the whole design process, yielding to the construction of semantic Web service applications spanning over several enterprises.},

	abstract = {Major research challenges in discovering Web services include, provisioning of services across multiple or heterogeneous registries, differentiating between services that share similar functionalities, improving end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS), and enabling clients to customize the discovery process. Proliferation and interoperability of this multitude of Web services have lead to the emergence of new standards on how services can be published, discovered, or used (i.e. UDDI, WSDL, SOAP). Such standards can potentially provide many of these features and much more, however, there are technical challenges associated with existing standards. One of these challenges is the client.s ability to control the discovery process across accessible service registries for finding services of interest. This work proposes a solution to this problem and introduces the Web Service Relevancy Function (WsRF) used for measuring the relevancy ranking of a particular Web service based on QoS metrics and client preferences. We present experimental validation, results, and analysis of the presented ideas.},

Among current architectures, Service Oriented Architectures aim to easily develop more adaptable Information Systems. Most often, Web Service is the fitted technical solution which provides the required loose coupling to achieve such architectures. However there is still much to be done in order to obtain a genuinely flawless Web Service, and current market implementations still do not provide adaptable Web Service behavior depending on the service contract. Therefore, our approach considers Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) as a new design solution for Web Services. Based on both WSDL and Policies contracts, this solution aims to allow better flexibility on both the client and server side. In this paper we expose our technical and concrete solution using Axis as the SOAP Engine, WSS4J as the WS-Security handler, and Javassist to weave some non-functional security aspects depending on the policies requirements.},

In this paper we objectify the WS-* vs. REST debate by giving a quantitative technical comparison based on architectural principles and decisions. We show that the two approaches differ in the number of architectural decisions that must be made and in the number of available alternatives. This discrepancy between freedom-from-choice and freedom-of-choice explains the complexity difference perceived. However, we also show that there are significant differences in the consequences of certain decisions in terms of resulting development and maintenance costs. Our comparison helps technical decision makers to assess the two integration styles and technologies more objectively and select the one that best fits their needs: REST is well suited for basic, ad hoc integration scenarios, WS-* is more flexible and addresses advanced quality of service requirements commonly occurring in enterprise computing.},

What has this focus on services done to the role of objects? Some of the more extreme SOA proponents maintain that service-reuse replaces object-reuse across the board. More mainstream architects view these two models as complementary reuse strategies at different levels of scale. There are even object diehards who think that services can't come close to the flexibility and durability of objects. This panel will represent the full range of opinions. Specifically, panelists and attendees will be challenged to explore such topics as: Where is the scalability boundary between object responsibilities and service responsibilities?

Where and how do binary components such as RMI, EJB, or CORBA fit in alongside more loosely-coupled interfaces such as web services?

	abstract = {Distributed applications are rapidly converging towards the adoption of a computing paradigm based on service-oriented architectures (SOA), according to which an application results from the composition of a set of services in execution on networked server hosts. In a SOA context, service providers are strategically interested both to describe the performance characteristics of offered services, to better qualify their offer and gain a significant advantage in the global marketplace, and to predict the level of performance that can be offered to service consumers when building composite web services that make use of services managed by various service providers. This paper introduces a model-driven approach for integrating performance prediction into service composition processes carried out by use of BPEL (Business Process Execution Language for Web Services). The proposed approach is founded on P-WSDL (Performance-enabled WSDL), a performance-oriented extension of WSDL, the language for describing the information about service capabilities and invocation mechanisms. P-WSDL is a lightweight WSDL extension for the description of performance characteristics of a web service. The approach is illustrated by use of an example application to a composite web service for travel planning.},

SO-SAM is an executable architectural model incorporating Predicate Transition Nets with the style and understandability of component-based concepts. SO-SAM describes each web service in terms of component and service composition in terms of connector separately. We believe that SO-SAM facilitates the verification and monitoring of web services integrationsince SO-SAM fits the distributed nature of modern composite web services. In order to validate the model against system properties, we rewrite the SO-SAM into the XMLformat, and validate SO-SAM using a SAM support tool, SAM parser.

	abstract = {A broad spectrum of electronic commerce applications is currently available on the Web, providing services in almost any area one can think of. As the number and variety of such applications grow, more business opportunities emerge for providing new services based on the integration and customization of existing applications. (Web shopping malls and support for comparative shopping are just a couple of examples.) Unfortunately, the diversity of applications in each specific domain and the disparity of interfaces, application flows, actor roles in the business transaction, and data formats, renders the integration and manipulation of applications a rather difficult task. In this paper we present the Application Manifold system, aimed at simplifying the intricate task of integration and customization of e-commerce applications. The scope of the work in this paper is limited to web-enabled e-commerce applications. We do not support the integration/customization of proprietary/legacy applications. The wrapping of such applications as web services is complementary to our work. Based on the emerging Web data standard, XML, and application modeling standard, UML, the system offers a novel declarative specification language for describing the integration/customization task, supporting a modular approach where new applications can be added and integrated at will with minimal effort. Then, acting as an application generator, the system generates a full integrated/customized e-commerce application, with the declarativity of the specification allowing for the optimization and verification of the generated application. The integration here deals with the full profile of the given e-commerce applications: the various services offered by the applications, the activities and roles of the different actors participating in the application (e.g., customers, vendors), the application flow, as well as with the data involved in the process. This is in contrast to previous works on Web data integration that focused primarily on querying the data available in the applications, mostly ignoring the additional aspects mentioned above.},

In this paper, we present a novel framework for enforcing access control in conversation-based Web services. Our approach takes into account the conversational nature of Web services. This is in contrast with existing approaches to access control enforcement that assume a Web service as a set of independent operations. Furthermore, our approach achieves a tradeoff between the need to protect Web service's access control policies and the need to disclose to clients the portion of access control policies related to the conversations they are interested in. This is important to avoid situations where the client cannot progress in the conversation due to the lack of required security requirements. We introduce the concept of k-trustworthiness that defines the conversations for which a client can provide credentials maximizing the likelihood that it will eventually hit a final state.},

An important challenge is their integration in order to provide new value-added composite services, allowing consequently Business-to-Business relationships. Therefore, many composition languages have been proposed in the past few years. However, a weakness of these languages is that they are difficult to use in early stages of development, such as specification. Thus, an extension to UML 2.0, named UML-S, was introduced to develop composite Web services conforming to the model-driven engineering vision. This paper introduces the necessary transformation rules between UML-S and low-level code to comply with MDE approach.},

Fallout of these spaghetti architectures is the development of the Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) concept. In this paper we are going to discuss the evolution of EAI concepts and a new architecture for event driven data transformation for application integration using Web Services. The new architecture overcomes the drawback of request-reply semantics of web services by providing an event driven architecture, which supports asynchronous communication between applications using web services. We have also implemented a secure framework for accessing third party web services using message level encryption and digital certificates.},

	abstract = {Looking at the state of the industry today, it is clear that we are in the early stages of Web Services development. Companies are still evaluating what the technology and considering how to apply it to their business. But over the past year, we seem to have reached an inflection point of companies building real systems based on Web Services. Partly this reflects an acceptance that the basic Web Services technologies - XML Schema [1][2], SOAP [3], WSDL [4] - have matured to the point where they can be used for mission critical applications. But it also reflects a growing understanding that Web Services enable a large class of systems that were previously very difficult to build. These systems are characterized by several critical properties:1. Rapid rates of change. The time is long past when companies could afford a year-long-effort to build out a new application. Businesses move at a faster pace today then ever before, and they are increasingly under pressure to do more work with fewer resources. This places a premium on the ability to build applications by quickly composing pre-existing services. The result is that systems are being connected in ways that were never imagined during development. This is reuse in the large - not just small services, but entire applications being linked together to solve a complex business function.2. Significant availability and scalability requirements. Many of these systems are ``bet-your-business'' types of applications. They have heavy scalability and availability requirements. Often then need to connect multiple partners and service hundreds of thousands of updates in a day, without ever suffering an interruption in service.3. Heterogeneous development tools and software platforms. Each of these applications typically involves components built using a wildly diverse set of tools, operating systems, and software platforms. Partly this is a result of building systems out of existing components - many of these components are locked into certain environments, and there are no resources to rewrite or migrate to a single homogenous platform. But it is also recognition that different problems are best solved by different toolsets. Some problems are best solved by writing code on an application server, others are best suited for scripting, and still others are solved by customizing an existing enterprise application. Heterogeneity is not going away. It is only increasing.4. Multiple domains of administrative control. An aspect of heterogeneity that is often overlooked is distributed ownership. As businesses merge, acquire, and partner with other companies, there is an increasing need to build applications that span organizational boundaries.These characteristics present a unique set of challenges to the way we think about developing, describing, connecting, and configuring applications. The challenges require us to develop new ways of looking at what it takes to build an application, and what makes up a network.In this session, we examine the nature of this next generation of application, and discuss the way in which Web Services are evolving to meet their needs. The session focuses on the development techniques that allow services to be easily and dynamically composed into rich applications, and considers the capabilities required of the underlying network fabric. The session concludes with an in-depth look at some of the critical Web Services specifications actively under development by industry leaders.},

Web service standards, based on WSDL (Web Service Definition Language), have been adopted as process-to-process communication paradigms. However, the conceptual modeling of applications using Web services has not yet been addressed. Interaction with Web services is often specified at the level of the source code; thus, Web service interfaces are buried within a programmatic specification.In this article, we argue that Web services should be considered first-class citizens in the specification of Web applications. Thus, service-enabled Web applications should benefit from the high-level modeling and automatic code generation techniques that have long been advocated for Web application design and implementation. To this end, we extend a declarative model for specifying data-intensive Web applications in two directions: (i) high-level modeling of Web services and their interactions with the Web applications which use them, and (ii) modeling and specification of Web applications implementing new, complex Web services.Our approach is fully implemented within a CASE tool allowing the high-level modeling and automatic deployment of service-enabled Web applications.},

Firstly, a combination with metadata annotation is needed to support the discovery of educational Web services. Secondly, if these components are to be provided in form of services, more support is needed for their assembly. Architectural patterns of a finer degree of granularity shall satisfy this need.},

In 2005, the annual middleware license revenue was reported by Gartner to be in the region of 8.5 billion US Dollars. In this article we address the question whether research had any involvement in the creation of the technology that is being sold in this market? We attempt a scholarly discourse. We present the research method that we have applied to answer this question. We then present a brief introduction into the key middleware concepts that provide the foundation for this market. It would not be feasible to investigate any possible impact that research might have had. Instead we select a few very successful technologies that are representative for the middleware market as a whole and show the existence of impact of research results in the creation of these technologies. We investigate the origins of web services middleware, distributed transaction processing middleware, message oriented middleware, distributed object middleware and remote procedure call systems. For each of these technologies we are able to show ample influence of research and conclude that without the research conducted by PhD students and researchers in university computer science labs at Brown, CMU, Cambridge, Newcastle, MIT, Vrije, and University of Washington as well as research in industrial labs at APM, AT\&T Bell Labs, DEC Systems Research, HP Labs, IBM Research and Xerox PARC we would not have middleware technology in its current form.

By contributing his own information services to the federation, each participant benefits from integrated access to services provided by other participants. However, integrated information services for use by external customers, based on SOA, are rare. One reason for this is the absence of technical mechanisms for information providers to share in the financial rewards associated with the provision of integrated information products to end-customers.This paper explores issues associated with the design of charging mechanisms within SOAs that permit dynamic composition of services to achieve customer goals. It proposes a suite of service components that can implement charging functions and explains their application within an application scenario. The scenario concerns an integrated service that is of interest to customers in local government practice, sociological research, and real property investment.},

Recently, self-adaptive applications have been recognized as viable solutions for dealing with systems where size and complexity increase beyond the ability of humans. However, self-adaptive solutions have been always studied in isolation, only involving single layers of the system (e.g. operative system, middleware, firmware, hardware). In this paper we discuss our novel idea of multi-layers deep adaptability of complex systems. We present an integrated approach for designing and coordinating applications with three-layers of self-adaptation. The solution proposed is based on specialized sense-plan-act control loops that interact each others to monitor both specific parts and also the global behavior of the system. These control loops sense unexpected behaviors that can compromise the system, then diagnose the system layer that needs an adaptation action, and finally act the proper adaptation strategy to overcome the revealed problems without user intervention. We validate the approach with a SOA-based application, the Virtual Tour Guide, designed with three-layers self-adaptive abilities in order to overcome functional/non-functional problems that can derive from the integration of heterogeneous and remote third-party services.},

These resources are often running on a variety of platforms, have different bandwidth and QoS requirements, require specific configuration by technical experts, and in most cases cannot be accessed through a single point of entry. To address these issues, we propose an extensible, reliable, and simple software architecture to share the applications and resources over hybrid networks, and hide the tools' logistical and provisioning complexities. This paper explores the design and implementation of Eucalyptus, and describes how it leverages the benefits of a Service-oriented Architecture (SoA) to provide a highly adaptable, modular, and loosely coupled solution to configure and manage resources needed by users collaborating over the net. We present our methodology to wrap functions of resources into Web services, and integrate the new Web services into the Eucalyptus platform in a generic way. The streams of the events from these resources are captured. This information is used for monitoring resources' activities and diagnosing any error that may arise. We provide a workflow management service allowing users to orchestrate services based on the description of the resources, their dependencies and the captured streams to perform certain tasks. We also propose a combination of Web services and peer to peer technologies to support users in different communities and different network layers, and to decentralize resource management. Eucalyptus was demonstrated to be effective in assisting architects across multiple sites to effectively participate in a shared design session.},

Starting with the impact of pervasive networking on computing models, manifested by now common grid and ubiquitous computing, this paper surveys related challenges for the middleware and related impact on the software development. Indeed, future applications will need to cope with advanced non-functional properties such as contextawareness and mobility, for which adequate middleware support must be devised together with accompanying software development notations, methods and tools. This leads us to introduce our view on next generation middleware, considering both technological advances in the networking area but also the need for closer integration with software engineering best practices, to ultimately suggest middleware-based software processes.},

Our first implementation relied on static configurations and needed manual intervention to respond to network and node outages. PlanetLab has Cloud Computing and Service Oriented Architecture features that enabled us to increase our application's robustness by using web services for Virtual Machine (VM) allocation, VM provisioning, resource availability, and geographic information. We found that we had to treat service provided resource information like network equipment treats network information. Despite the lack of service level guarantees for PlanetLab VMs and Internet connectivity, we constructed a robust global monitoring service that is used by Intel network personnel today.},

	abstract = {The bulk of proposed pervasive computing devices such as PDAs and cellular telephones operate as thin clients within a larger infrastructure. To access services within their local environment, these devices participate in a service discovery protocol which involves a master directory that registers all services available in the local environment. These directories typically are isolated from each other. Devices that move across service discovery domains have no access to information outside their current local domain. In this paper we propose an application-level protocol called VIA that enables data sharing among discovery domains. Each directory maintains a table of active links to other directories that share related information. A set of linked directories forms a data cluster that can be queried by devices for information. The data cluster is distributed, self-organizing, responsive to data mobility, and robust to failures. Using application-defined data schemas, clusters organize themselves into a hierarchy for efficient querying and network resource usage. Through analysis and simulation we describe the behavior of VIA under different workloads and show that the protocol overhead for both maintaining a cluster and handling failures grows slowly with the number of gateways.},

	abstract = {The widespread deployment of inexpensive communications technology, computational resources in the networking infrastructure, and network-enabled end devices poses an interesting problem for end users: how to locate a particular network service or device out of hundreds of thousands of accessible services and devices. This paper presents the architecture and implementation of a secure wide-area Service Discovery Service (SDS). Service providers use the SDS to advertise descriptions of available or already running services, while clients use the SDS to compose complex queries for locating these services. Service descriptions and queries use the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) to encode such factors as cost, performance, location, and device- or service-specific capabilities. The SDS provides a fault-tolerant, incrementally scalable service for locating services in the wide-area. Security is a core component of the SDS: communications are both encrypted and authenticated where necessary, and the system uses a hybrid access control list and capability system to control access to service information. Wide-area query routing is also a core component of the SDS: all information in the system is potentially reachable by all clients.},

Most current approaches for web service discovery cater to semantic web services, i.e., web services that have associated semantic descriptions. It is unrealistic, however, to expect all new services to have associated semantic descriptions. Furthermore, the descriptions of the vast majority of already existing services do not have explicitly associated semantics. In this paper we present a novel approach for web service discovery that combines semantic and statistical association metrics. Semantic metrics are based on the semantic aspects of relevant ontology. Statistical association metrics are based on the association aspects of web services instances (their inputs and outputs). Specifically, our approach exploits semantic relationship ranking for establishing semantic relevance, and a hyperclique pattern discovery method for grouping web service parameters into meaningful associations. These associations combined by the semantic relevance are then leveraged to discover and rank web services.},

However, little care has been taken towards the need of execution environments that support the discovery of replacement services that become unavailable or fail to meet certain requirements at run-time. To adress this shortcoming, this paper proposes an extension to our semantic framework for engineering Web services compositions. This extension consists of a run-time service discovery tool. The key contribution of the paper is the combination of components for monitoring composition requirements at run-time, and components for discovering services at run-time. The former components detect violations of requirements at run-time. The framework uses the specifications of the violated requirements to generate queries for discovering services that could substitute for malfunctioning services. These queries incorporate both structural and behavioural aspects of the required services and are executed by the run-time service discovery component of the framework.},

It is unified because it subsumes an array of disparate concepts, interfaces and protocols under a single semi-transparent umbrella. It is modular because it defines a small set of orthogonal multipurpose communication primitives (building blocks) for discovery. These primitives cover service identification, service description retrieval, data publication as well as minimal and powerful query support. The architecture is open and flexible because each primitive can be used, implemented, customized and extended in many ways. It is powerful because the individual primitives can be combined and plugged together by specific clients and services to yield a wide range of behaviors and emerging synergies.},

Service discovery protocols make it possible for participating nodes in a network to locate and advertise services with minimum user intervention. However, because it is not possible to predict at design time which protocols will be used to advertise services in a given context/environment, it is now becoming clear that dynamic discovery mechanisms are required by mobile nodes to cope with the heterogeneity of discovery platforms. Existing adaptive mobile middleware solutions such as ReMMoC and INDISS have investigated this style of dynamic discovery. However, these have yet to consider the emerging suite of protocols for discovery in ad-hoc networks. In this paper we present a component-based service discovery framework for the development of an adaptive multi-personality service discovery middleware, which will operate in diverse environments e.g. fixed and ad-hoc networks. This supports a common architecture for individual discovery protocols to enhance configurability and re-configurability of the framework, and minimize resource usage through component reuse. Finally, to evaluate this framework we investigate the development of four existing ad-hoc service discovery protocols using our approach.},

To guarantee certain quality of services of the composite service, one can think of two paths ahead: quality of service negotiation and guarantee prior to service deployment and bindings; or a more speculative and adaptive behavior at runtime. In this position paper we propose a hybrid approach, combining development and runtime information to make the web services adapt to workload variations. The approach combines control theory with performance modeling and is built around a model of the web service. A control loop theory approach is taken to model discovery. The control loop allows for keeping the web service's performance even when the model is not completely known and failure of components of the control loop are likely to happen. The approach is related to robust state estimation. The robustness makes the model insensitive to parameter variations and to uncertainties in the model. With appropriate conditions, the above concept can be extended to the external environments in which the web service has to perform.},

The GIS platform architecture is designed as a multi-layer architecture that integrates the Web service, Servlet/JSP functions and GIS APIs based on the framework of J2EE infrastructure. The Web service framework was applied to the GIS system design and implementation. GIS Web services were designed to provide the hosted spatial data and GIS functionality to integrate the customized GIS applications to perform basic geo-processing tasks, such as address matching, map image display, and routing, without maintaining GIS tools or the associated geographical data.

In this paper we are going to discuss about the evolution of EAI concepts and a new architecture for event driven data transformation for application integration using Web services. The new architecture overcomes the drawback of request-reply semantics of Web services by providing an event driven architecture, which supports asynchronous communication between applications using Web services.

	abstract = {The service-oriented architecture (SOA) has become today's reference architecture for modern distributed systems. As SOA concepts and technologies become more and more widespread and the number of services in operation within enterprises increases, the problem of managing these services becomes manifest. One of the most pressing needs we hear from customers is the ability to "discover", within a maze of services each offering functionality to (and in turn using functionality offered by) other services, which are the actual dependencies between such services. Understanding dependencies is essential to performing two functions: impact analysis (understanding which other services are affected when a service becomes unavailable) and service-level root-cause analysis (which is the opposite problem: under-standing the causes of a service failure by looking at the other services it relies on). Discovering dependencies is essential as the hope that the enterprise maintains documentation that describe these dependencies (on top of a complex maze and evolving implementations) is vane. Hence, we have to look for dependencies by observing and analyzing the interactions among services. In this paper we identify the importance of the problem of discovering dynamic dependencies among Web services and we propose a solution for the automatic identification of traces of dependent messages, based on the correlation of messages exchanged among services. We also discuss our lessons learned and results from applying the techniques to data related to HP processes and services.},

However, an architecture framework that addresses the overall accountability requirements is nonetheless missing in a service-oriented computing environment. In this paper, we review the accountability literature in an IT context and argue that disclosure, as a crucial requirement of accountability, has been largely ignored in the current literature. Based on this proposition, we propose a new architectural framework to address the important disclosure requirement that extends and integrates the existing architecture models. The proposed framework can be used to build SOA solutions that support the key accountability requirements.},

The SOA concept evolves from earlier component-based software frameworks. However, since Web services standards are based on readily and openly available Internet protocols, and thus much cheaper and easier for companies to adopt, major computer and IT companies have quickly embraced SOA. Web 2.0 promotes Web experiences that encourage users to participate in sharing information and enriching services. Users may offer their own contributions as open services to be composed into new components and services. In addition, the combined network effects of pervasive two-way participation are creating a phenomenal communal service architecture on the Web. In order for users and companies to share knowledge and co-produce with peers anywhere, without synchronization, delay, or maintenance, they need to use some powerful underlying set of technologies and paradigms. This is where SOA may provide some help. This talk discuss the service technology challenges and opportunities that are introduced by the dynamism of Web 2.0 services and requirements. The issues may require new concepts, methods, models, and technologies along with flexible and adaptive infrastructures for services composition and management in order to facilitate the two-way integration and formation of services across different sources. The future success of SOA will rely on the development of novel technologies to meet these new demands from the evolving Web 2.0 paradigm},

As enterprises merge, split up, or grow, existing legacy systems from different vendors implemented in different programming languages and running in different environments as well as roll-your-own applications have to be integrated. Furthermore, companies are starting to shift more and more on-premise software to software run in aSoftware as a Service (SaaS) business model. Outsourcing software to external and internal SaaS providers introduces new integration challenges, namely those of the integration of standard SaaS software with on-premise systems or other systems run at different SaaS providers which is a problem not addressed by SaaS platforms today. Recurring integration problems can be described by means of Enterprise Application Integration patterns. Those are used as nuggets of advice to solve complex integration problems. In this paper, we introduce executable EAI patterns offered in a SaaS business model to allow companies to focus on the integration without the need for the setup of complex integration infrastructures. Users will be guided by workflows customizing configurable EAI patterns to easily create integration solutions. We therefore propose EAI as a Service as a flexible, customizable, inexpensive way to tackle EAI problems both of on-premise systems but also of systems run in a SaaS business model.},

To facilitate discovery of Web Services in dynamic environments, both service description and distribution of descriptions must be improved. Several research efforts target semantic description of services. However, Semantic Web Service discovery in peer-to-peer-like, dynamic environments where services and registries are transient cannot be based on current mechanisms for distribution of Web Service descriptions. Based on a set of generic requirements, we introduce a conceptual architecture that aims to solve many of the problems related to Semantic Web Service discovery in dynamic environments. The architecture is based on a distributed multi-registry topology and aliveness information. We present several research problems we have identified during our initial work on this architecture.},

The protocol is based on the concepts of peer-to-peer caching of service advertisements and group-based intelligent forwarding of service requests. It does not require a service to be registered with a registry or lookup server. Services are described using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). We exploit the semantic class/subClass hierarchy of OWL to describe service groups and use this semantic information to selectively forward service requests. OWL-based service description also enables increased flexibility in service matching. We present simulation results that show that our protocol achieves increased efficiency in discovering services (compared to traditional broadcast-based mechanisms) by efficiently utilizing bandwidth via controlled forwarding of service requests.},

We define meta service discovery and explain the motivation for it.

This is the aim of leveraging a open standards- based service delivery platform. To identify and to cope with those challenges is the main target of the EU funded project IST DAIDALOS II. And a central point to satisfy the changing user needs is the provision of a well working, user friendly and personalized service discovery. This paper describes our work in the project on a middleware in a framework for pervasive service usage. We have designed an architecture for it, that enables full transparency to the user, grants high compatibility and extendability by a modular and pluggable conception and allows for interoperability with most known service discovery protocols. Our multi-protocol service discovery and the four phases service filtering concept enabling personalization should allow for the best possible results in service discovery.},

In addition, constant changes in business environment have increased the difficulty of software development. Many styles such as heavy SOA style, the workflow-oriented architectural style, and original rest style are created to solve these problems. Unfortunately, the previous studies did not take into account all aspects, and made a number of assumptions excluding the realistic complexity and mutability to facilitate research. This paper attempts to find out the architectural constraints contained in the architectural styles by analyzing the styles mentioned above and to design a set of architectural constraints, which can induce desirable architectural properties for e-commerce applications - e-commerce application architectural style based on the integration of workflow and agile service. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of this architectural style by theoretical derivation and implementation experience.},

By doing so, it ensures that the services having some mutual replaceability are organized in the same path of RSLattice.

In particular, the possibility of composing already implemented web services in order to provide a new functionality is an interesting approach for building distributed applications and business processes. The possibility of dynamically composing web services is also apparent. Current approaches address to this point, but they do not adopt established specifications, like WS-BPEL, as they usually propose modifications in the rules of business process specifications by imposing more difficulties to implement the system. This paper proposes a policy-driven approach for enabling web service adaptability through a semantic modification in the invocation primitive of WS-BPEL, whilst mantains its syntax unaffected. Hence, programmers may define dynamic web service compositions without changing the source code. The approach has been applied to a loan approval system in order to illustrate it.},

The proposed solution exploits ideas from autonomic computing and self-managed software. We propose a design methodology based on the definition of both test cases, to automatically diagnose service mismatches, and adaptation strategies, to overcome the revealed problems. We introduce a general runtime infrastructure that automatically embeds the test cases and the adaptation strategies into service based applications to guarantee self-adaptiveness.},
